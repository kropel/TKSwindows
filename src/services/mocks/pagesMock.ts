        content: `<p>Sash windows have a traditional, authentic feel that plastic or aluminium products cannot match – possibly one of the main reasons for their enduring popularity.</p>
        <p>Given that many properties have had their sash windows for several years, it’s more than likely that your windows are in need of replacement. We often find that timber products are not necessarily maintained as much as they should be over their lifetime, with paint being left peeling on the outside of the window allowing water to ingress into the timber which eventually results in a difficult to operate window and further loss of paint as the timber becomes waterlogged. If you’ve noticed any of these issues and want to look into replacing your windows, please email or call us.</p>`,

        content: `<p>Casement windows are the most popular windows across the United Kingdom and Europe. Essentially a casement is any window that operates on hinges. Our aluminium and timber casement windows offer great levels of heat retention and sound reduction, and are available with double or triple glazing. Since a casement window operates on hinges, there’s much more variation in design and there’s something for everyone.</p>`,

        title: 'Bespoke Designs',
        url: 'bespoke-designs',
        content: `<p>Compared to timber sash windows, aluminium windows are a relatively new product. Since they haven’t been around long enough for a unique style to develop, you have a bit more freedom with how they look. Most of the time, people tend to go for as little frame as they can. Aluminium is strong – such that the frames don’t have to be that big. This ensures that you will have as large a glass area as possible so natural light can flood the rooms. You will never see the same curves and traditional moulding that you would on a sash window, but if you are more about just letting the light into your home, aluminium might be the best option for you.</p>`,

If you are really unlucky you might find yourself locked out of your house. Front doors are one of the main culprits of draught in the home, so it’s good to give it some TLC every now and again. If your door is difficult to open, draughty or if you feel it may be insecure, it may be time to think about changing it.</p>`,

While aluminium doors can never match the familiar timber aesthetic, it does offer strength, durability and high resistance. This gives you slim profiles, less frame and more glass thanks to its natural strength. Between our aluminium and our timber products, and with the wide range of finishes available, we can cater to almost any taste.</p>`,

These doors allow natural light into the property while saving the space that would usually be taken up by the opening door sashes and so are great for properties that don’t have a lot of room.</p>`,

Using aluminium for a product allows you to keep the frames thin, so you can flood your room with daylight. Because of the modern material, you are still benefiting from anti-corrosion, durability and high resistance.`,

        <h3>Double glazing</h3>

        <p>Typically, double glazed units comprise a 4mm pane of glass, a 12mm or 16mm gap and then another 4mm pane. These units are all assembled and then inserted into the window by hand. The presence of Argon gas within the unit slows the movement of warm air within the glass unit. Other gasses can be sourced, Krypton for example, if you need more heat insulation.</p>
        <p>The low-emissivity coating means that these double glazed units are designed for optimal energy efficiency. They also help to retain thermal energy by reflecting heat back to its source.</p>
        <p>By large double glazing is enough for the weather in the UK. Although we can provide triple glazing, in most cases we would recommend our customers to go with the standard option of double glazing as it is all they typically need.</p>
        <p>Double glazing is good for the environment in many ways, in addition to keeping you warm. The energy saving reduces the amount of wasted power and the timber can be recycled from the frames (unlike plastic windows). With single glazing much of the energy you use to heat your home is wasted. With double glazing, your home is far more energy efficient.</p>
        
        <h3>Soundproof glaze </h3>
        
        <p>We offer special, upgraded glazing to reduce the noise inside the property.</p>
        <p>The standard double-glazed windows are size 4/16/4, soundproofing 32dB; window wing thickness 24mm. An upgraded soundproofing option we recommend is 6/14/4 and 34dB. Window wing thickness 24mm.</p>
        <p>To understand the difference in dB: an increase by 1dB reduces the noise by half.</p>`,
